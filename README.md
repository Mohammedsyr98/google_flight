# Google Flights Clone - React App

This project replicates a Google Flights-like feature, allowing users to search for flights, view results, and filter by various criteria such as destinations, dates, and price. It is built with **React**, **Material UI**, **Axios**, **React Query**, and the **Sky-Scrapper API** for fetching flight data.

## Features

- **Flight Search**: Users can search for flights by entering a departure location, destination, and dates.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **API Integration**: Fetch flight data using the **Sky-Scrapper API** from RapidAPI.
- **Debounced Search**: Implements debouncing in the location input field to minimize API calls when typing.
- **TypeScript**: The project is built with TypeScript for better type safety and development experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Material UI**: For pre-built UI components.
- **Axios**: For making API requests.
- **React Query**: For managing and caching API data.
- **Sky-Scrapper API**: For flight data.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety.
